Act as an expert Front-End Web Developer. I need you to build a responsive, single-page web application to generate a "One Page Report (OPR)" for school co-curricular activities.

The project should be ready to be hosted on GitHub Pages (static HTML, CSS, JS).

**Core Functionality:**
1.  **Input Form:** A clean interface for teachers to input the following details:
    * Tajuk Program (Program Title)
    * Tarikh (Date)
    * Masa (Time)
    * Tempat (Venue)
    * Sasaran (Target Audience)
    * Objektif Program (Objectives - Textarea)
    * Aktiviti Program (Activities - Textarea)
    * Impak Program (Impact - Textarea)
    * Cadangan Penambahbaikan (Suggestions - Textarea)
    * Anjuran (Organizer)
2.  **Image Upload:** Allow users to upload exactly 3 images. These images should be previewed in the layout.
3.  **PDF Generation:** A button "Jana PDF & Muat Turun" that converts the report layout into an A4 PDF file using client-side libraries (like html2canvas and jspdf).

**Design & Branding Requirements:**
1.  **Header:**
    * Must include the school logo on the left (assume filename is 'logo.jpg').
    * School Name: "SMKA TOK BACHOK".
    * Slogan: Must prominently display "Tok Bachok Memang Best" in the header design.
2.  **Layout:**
    * The generated report part must look like a formal A4 document.
    * Use a table or grid layout to organize the text fields clearly.
    * The 3 images should be arranged neatly at the bottom or side of the report.
3.  **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS via CDN for rapid, modern styling. The color scheme should match the provided logo (red, blue, yellow, black).

**Technical Stack:**
* HTML5
* Tailwind CSS (CDN)
* Vanilla JavaScript
* Libraries: `jspdf` and `html2canvas` (include via CDN links).

**Output:**
Provide the complete `index.html` code containing the CSS, JS, and HTML structure. Ensure the code handles the image file reading (FileReader API) so the uploaded images appear in the PDF without needing a server.
